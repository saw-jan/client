Feature: Sharing

    As a user
    I want to share files and folders with other users
    So that those users can access the files and folders


    Background:
        Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files

    @smokeTest
    Scenario: simple sharing
        Given user "Brian" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
        And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt" on the server
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
        When the user adds "Brian Murphy" as collaborator of resource "textfile0.txt" with permissions "edit,share" using the client-UI
        Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed in the collaborators list for file "textfile0.txt" with permissions "edit,share" on the client-UI


    Scenario: Share files/folders with special characters in their name
        Given user "Brian" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files

        And the user adds "Brian Murphy" as collaborator of resource "$ample1?.txt" with permissions "edit,share" using the client-UI
        Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed in the collaborators list for file "SampleFolder,With,$pecial?Characters" with permissions "edit,share" on the client-UI
        And user "Brian Murphy" should be listed in the collaborators list for file "$ample1?.txt" with permissions "edit,share" on the client-UI
